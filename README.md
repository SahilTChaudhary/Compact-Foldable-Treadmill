# INTRODUCTION

In the age of COVID’19, with the onset of social distancing and lockdowns, people have been restricted to their homes for months at a stretch. This has led to a sedentary lifestyle and a lack of daily exercise. It is proven that running and even walking is one of the most efficient methods of exercise. Unfortunately, most treadmills are very bulky, take up a lot of space, and are very difficult to transport from one place to another. So, we have designed a compact and foldable treadmill which can easily be stored under the bed or inside a cupboard, hence eliminating the problem of space and transportation.

**Work Done**

* Designed the CAD model using Fusion 360
* Calculated the applied Impulse Load and Failure Load, and conducted Static Structural Analysis using Ansys
* Designed a folding mechanism for the treadmill by folding the deck in half for easy storage
* The Treadmill is a manual one aimed at walking, with an inclination of 15° to facilitate easy movement
* The Treadmill can withstand a load of 120kg, with a Factor of Safety of 6
